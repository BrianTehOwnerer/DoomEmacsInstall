# DoomEmacsInstall
Automatic install of doom emacs on windows systems
 It will do it all, install emacs, set up all the path enviornmental veriables for you, as well as download and "install" doom emacs.
 It will also set up a nice desktop shortcut for you (that will try and connect to an emacs 'server' and if it doesnt find one, start it itself)
 and also set up a emacs server on login.
